# Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Machine Learning Techniques

An individual report was created for the BIOST 544: Machine Learning for Biomedical and Public Health Big Data to classify patients into healthy adults or adults with Alzheimer’s disease using multiple methods, including k-nearest neighbors, lasso regression, and boosted trees. The data was divided into a training and test set, with the test set outcomes unavailable to students.

# Contents

The report, code, and dataset (titled ADProj) are uploaded to this repository. If the dataset is saved to the same directory that the working directory is set to, the dataset can be imported to R directly using the code.

# Lessons Learned

I was able to understand the theory more deeply behind the three machine models I chose for this model, as well as techniques to implement the models in R. I am now more confident in my abilities to choose accurate models based on validation set or cross-validation results. This project was also a great learning experience due to the fact that I was unable to see the test set outcomes, making this project more closely mimic a real-life machine learning problem.
